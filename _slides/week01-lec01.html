# Welcome to CS 272 Software Development

---

# Course Introduction 1

- Inspired by Prof. Engle's successful course
    - Modern SW development practices
    - Code-review centric
    - Similar policies 

---

# Course Introduction 2

- But not exactly the same
    - Implementation language: Java -> Go
    - Database: SQL -> MongoDB
    - Teaching style?

---

# Instructor Introduction

- Professional Background
- Teaching Experience

---

# Class Introductions

- Icebreaker
    - Your name (nickname?)
    - Hometown
    - A non-tech thing you do for fun

---

# Syllabus Review

- Noteworthy Policies
    - Letter Grade Scale
    - Late Work
    - Original Work

---

# Course Deliverables 1

- Attendance
- Weekly assignments
    - Low-stakes labs build into higher-stakes projects
- Regular code reviews
- Two exams: one before Fall Break, one after

---

# Course Deliverables 2

- Four significant projects
    - Learning Go
    - Indexing Web Sites
    - Persisting the index in MongoDB
    - Front-end in TypeScript

---

# Expectations

- The workload will be significant but doable
- Attendance is mandatory - the pandemic is over
- Small sections: more interaction, questions
- Review CampusWire Etiquette
- There are no dumb questions
<br><br>
- Pro Tip: Your future manager expects you to manage your productivity

# Why Go?

---

# Starting with C (1970s)

### Pro
+ Source code is portable across processor architectures
+ Compiles to machine code (high performance)

### Con
- C does not help large teams writing large projects
- C is not memory-safe (`NULL` pointers, `malloc/free` bugs, buffer overflow, ugh!)
- C is not strongly-typed
---

# C++ (1980s)

### Pro
+ C++ is a super-set of C and adds OOP classes, inheritance, etc
+ C++ is strongly-typed

### Con
- Still not memory-safe, but classes can localize risk
- "Modern C++" is a large, complex langauage

--- 

# Java (1990s)

### Pro
- Object-Oriented
- Suitable for large teams/projects
- Performance is acceptable for some applications
- Java is memory-safe (GC, immutable strings)

### Con
- Large, complex language
- GC takes too much time for some applications

---

# Go (2010s)

### Pro

- Compiles to machine code
- Small, simple language, especially for concurrency
- OO, but simpler than C++ or Java
- Memory-safe (GC and immutable strings)

### Con
- Newer language, not as widely deployed as C/C++ and Java
- GC takes too much time for some applications

---

# Rust

### Pro
- Compiles to machine code
- Memory-safe, but no Garbage Collector
- Compiler tracks all memory references and "borrows" a pointer value when needed
- Probably the future of "systems" programming

---

# Moral of the Story
